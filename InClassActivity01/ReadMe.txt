While it is still a little bit unclear as to the more in depth nature of how these shaders work specifically, as well as
how some of the more specific lines of codes and methods e.t.c. work. It was very interesting to see the completed product of the shaders 
and what they look like in engine, as well as it providiing some insight into things that can be achieved using these shaders and potenital use cases
for them. Particularly focussing on the reflection based shader, it was very intersting to see how something like that works firsthand, as
I imagine it will be a usefull skill to have access to later down the line, even if like I said, I am still a little unsure of how it works exactly
from a development standpoint.
